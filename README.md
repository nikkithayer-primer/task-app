## File Structure

```
task-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # All CSS styles
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.js          # Main application initialization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ storage.js      # localStorage management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui.js           # UI utilities and interactions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ finance.js      # Finance tracking functionality

â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This file
```

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture for easy maintenance and extension:

- **Storage Module**: Handles all localStorage operations with error handling
- **UI Module**: Manages interface interactions, date formatting, and display logic
- **Finance Module**: Handles finance form validation, submission, and display
- **Media Module**: Manages media logging functionality
- **App Module**: Coordinates all modules and handles global functionality

## Extending the Application

The modular structure makes it easy to add new features:

### Adding New Fields

1. Update the HTML form in `index.html`
2. Modify the corresponding module (`finance.js` or `media.js`)
3. Update the `getFormData()` and `validateFormData()` functions
4. Adjust the display logic in the UI module if needed

### Adding New Tabs

1. Add new tab button and content section in `index.html`
2. Create a new JavaScript module following the existing pattern
3. Initialize the new module in `app.js`
4. Update the storage module with new data keys

### Adding Analytics

The modules already include helper functions for statistics:
- `Finance.getStatistics()` - spending analysis
- `Media.getStatistics()` - consumption patterns
- `App.getAppStatistics()` - combined data

## Data Storage

Data is stored in the browser's localStorage:
- Finance entries: `taskTracker_finances`
- Media entries: `taskTracker_media`

Each entry includes:
- Unique ID
- Timestamp
- Description
- Worth it flag
- Amount (finance only)

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- localStorage
- ES6 features (const, let, arrow functions)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
