## Setup Instructions

### For GitHub Pages Deployment

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Update API configuration** in `js/config.js`:
   ```javascript
   const Config = {
       API_BASE_URL: 'https://your-api-server.com',
       // ... other settings
   };
   ```
3. **Push to GitHub repository**
4. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
5. **Access your site** at `https://yourusername.github.io/task-app`

### For Server-Side Storage

To enable shared storage between you and your husband, you'll need to:

1. **Set up a backend API** that supports:
   - `GET /finances` - Get all finance entries
   - `POST /finances` - Add new finance entry
   - `DELETE /finances/:id` - Delete finance entry
   - `GET /media` - Get all media entries
   - `POST /media` - Add new media entry
   - `DELETE /media/:id` - Delete media entry

2. **Update the API_BASE_URL** in `js/config.js`

3. **Optional**: Add authentication to prevent unauthorized access

### Fallback Mode

If no server is available, the app automatically falls back to local storage. Each person's data will be stored locally on their device.

## Usage

### Adding Entries
1. **Select tab** (Finances or Media) at the top
2. **Fill in the form** at the bottom of the screen
3. **Toggle thumbs up/down** for "worth it" rating
4. **Tap send button** to save

### Managing Entries
- **View entries** in the table format
- **Swipe left** on any entry to delete it
- **Entries are sorted** by date (newest first)

### Mobile Tips
- Form stays at bottom near keyboard for easy typing
- Tabs stay at top for quick switching
- Swipe gestures work with both touch and mouse

## Customization

### Colors
All colors are defined as CSS variables in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --color-warm-white: #faf9f7;
    --color-sage: #9caf88;
    --color-terracotta: #d2691e;
    /* ... and more */
}
```

### Configuration
App settings can be modified in `js/config.js`:

```javascript
const Config = {
    SWIPE_THRESHOLD: 100,        // pixels to swipe for delete
    SWIPE_TIME_LIMIT: 1000,      // max swipe time (ms)
    DATE_FORMAT: 'DD/MM/YY',     // date display format
};
```
